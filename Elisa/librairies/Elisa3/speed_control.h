 The PID controller for the robot velocity is based on the back-emf technique for measuring the 
 current speed of each motor. The module contains both the vertical and horizontal controllers that 
 are activated automatically based on the current orientation of the robot.
 The two controllers work basically the same way, they differ only on the feed forward parameter handling, 
 that in the case of the vertical controller depends on the vetical orientation of the robot (when the robot 
 is moving up then the feed forward is increased, whereas when the robot is moving down then the feed forward 
 is decreased). The controllers are separated for each motor.
 The values of the input arguments and parameters are choosen in order to work only with 2 bytes integers.
