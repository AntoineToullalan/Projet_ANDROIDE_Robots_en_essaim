 The RGB leds are handled with the timer1 that can manage three different pwm, one used for each
 color. The frequency for the three pwm remains the same, but the duty cycle (led luminosity) can be 
 changed independently from each other, letting creating a wide range of different colors.
 Moreover the module contains functions for handling the small green leds placed around the robot.
