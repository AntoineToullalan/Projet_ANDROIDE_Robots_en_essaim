 The adc peripheral is initialized to work in free running mode, raising an interrupt at
 each conversion completion. Within the interrupt service routine the value is saved in its
 correct position and the next channel to sample is selected.
 This is the biggest interrupt in the project and it's used also as the base time for timed 
 processes/funtions (resolution 104 us).
 All the proximity and ground sensors are updated at 80 Hz (both active and passive phase).
